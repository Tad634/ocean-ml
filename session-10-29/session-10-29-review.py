# With your partner: discuss: What is a set? What is it good for?
# Write your response as a comment here:
#It is good for storing data. It is an unordered list that stores data.

# Create a variable called "myset" and put whatever you want in it:
myset = {"hello", 5, 4}


# Create a 2D numpy array of size 3x5 with numbers 1-5:
a = np.array([(1,2,3,4,5), (6,7,8,9,10), (11,12,13,14,15)])


# From your array, print the number 7:
print(a[1,1])


# Challenge: use while loop to print the following pattern:
# ****
# ***
# **
# *
i = "****"
